\begin{problem}{Spherical pendulum} Write the Lagrangian for a spherical pendulum (a bob of mass $m$ attached to a mass-less rigid rod of length $l$) using spherical coordinates and identify all conserved quantities. A spherical pendulum is the generalized case of the simple pendulum when the mass is not constrained to swing in a plane.

\begin{problem}{Two masses on a spring} Two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, are connected by a spring of rest length $l$ and spring constant $k$. The two masses are constrained to move in one dimension, along the x-axis, on a friction-less surface.\\

\textbf{a)} Give the Lagrangian for the system and write the equations of motion for the two masses\\
\textbf{b)} Show that the total linear momentum in the x-direction, $P_x$, is conserved ($P_x=m_1v_1+mv_2$)\\
\textbf{c)} List all conserved quantities for the system.

\begin{problem}{Arbitrary potential}Calculate the conserved quantities for the Lagrangian:
\begin{align*}
L=\frac{1}{2}m_1\dot{q}_1^2+\frac{1}{2}m_2\dot{q}_2^2-V(aq_1-bq_2)
\end{align*}
where $a$ and $b$ are constants, and V() is some unknown function of the linear combination $aq_1-bq_2$.

\begin{problem}{Spring pendulum with two masses} The pendulum in figure \ref{fig:SpringPendulumTwoMass} is constructed with two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, a spring of constant $k$ and rest length $d$. Mass $m_2$ is fixed at the end of a mass-less rigid rod of length $l$, while $m_1$ can slide without friction along the rod and is connected to the spring.\\
